      text1": Coping with extreme poverty and high mobility, the homeless are facing
        the issue of keeping their documents safe, which is essential in order
        to obtain social benefits.
      text2": Reconnect allows to safely store the copy of all essential documents,
        scanned or pictured, as well as contacts, appointments and memos. In
        case of losing the original documents, the consequences are thus
        limited.
      text3": The Reconnect Centres support the users in the creation and management
        of their Reconnect account.
      text4": The creation of a Reconnect account is freely offered to people living
        in extreme poverty in the Reconnect Centres.
      text5": Reconnect adapts to the wants and needs of its users, who are free to
        choose whether or not they want to share their data and documents with
        social workers.
      text6": The user can access his account without being affiliated to a Reconnect
        Centre. If he decides to quit his centre, he will be able to benefit
        from his Reconnect devices for an unlimited period of time. If he
        chooses a new centre, he will again be able to share his essential
        documents.
      text7": Reconnect is a device meant to last, which adapts to the social
        background of everyone. By using Reconnect, social actors can accompany
        people living in extreme poverty toward the autonomous usage of a
        digital tool.
      text8": Storing and sharing information and documents online. <br/> Reminder of
        memos and events via SMS.<br/> Simulation of the social rights for which
        the users are eligible and automatic creation of an administrative
        record from the available documents in the safe.
